# A Sequential Task-based Learning Path for Diffusion Models
This repository provides a structured, bottom-up learning path for understanding and implementing diffusion models in Python. It includes a sequence of coding tasks that start from foundational concepts in probability, stochastic processes, and generative modeling, leading up to full-fledged diffusion model implementations.

Each task comes with clear objectives, dataset recommendations, and progressive difficulty, covering topics like Gaussian noise, Markov processes, VAEs, denoising autoencoders, forward and reverse diffusion, noise prediction, U-Net architectures, and advanced techniques like DDIM and class-conditional generation.

The tasks are divided into two types, namely, Prerequisite Tasks (Pre Tasks) and Core Tasks.

You can consider the Pre Tasks to be optional, if you are confident enough.
