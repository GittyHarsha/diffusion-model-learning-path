# Core Task 3: Noise Prediction with a Neural Network
In this task, you will train a neural network to predict noise added during the forward diffusion process. The ability to accurately predict noise is crucial for learning the reverse diffusion process, which ultimately allows the model to generate high-quality images from pure noise.


## Task Description
- Test the trained network on noisy images.
- Measure how well it predicts the actual noise using MSE.
- Try using a U-Net instead of an MLP for better predictions.
- Experiment with different noise schedules and observe their effect.
